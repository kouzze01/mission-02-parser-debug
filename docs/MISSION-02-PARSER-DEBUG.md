# MISSION-02: Parser Bug Hunt

| | |
|---|---|
| **Program** | Level Up with AI |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Time Target** | 15-30 minutes |
| **Requires** | Claude Code 2.1.1 |

## The Bug

You updated Claude Code and now it crashes when you type `/` followed by any character:

```
TypeError: $.description.split is not a function
```

Your `~/.claude/skills/` folder has 8 skill files. **4 of them are broken.**

Find them. Fix them. Document your methodology.

---

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the challenge
gh repo clone Soul-Brews-Studio/mission-02-parser-debug
cd mission-02-parser-debug

# Copy challenge skills to your Claude skills folder
cp -r challenge-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Restart Claude Code (or open new terminal)
# Try typing "/" - it should crash
```

---

## Your Mission

1. **Reproduce** the crash (type `/` in Claude Code)
2. **Find** which 4 files cause the crash
3. **Fix** the files so Claude Code works again
4. **Document** your debugging approach

---

## Rules

- You **CANNOT** read this README during debugging (close it first)
- You **CANNOT** use grep to search for the answer
- You **MUST** use systematic debugging (not random guessing)
- You **MUST** document each step you take
- **TIME YOURSELF**

---

## Submission

Create a GitHub issue with:

1. **Which 4 files were broken** (file paths)
2. **What was wrong** (the bug pattern)
3. **Your debugging steps** (timeline with timestamps)
4. **Time to solve** (from first crash to all fixed)

### Submission Format

```markdown
## MISSION-02 Submission

**Time to solve**: XX minutes

### Broken Files Found

1. `path/to/file1.md` - description of bug
2. `path/to/file2.md` - description of bug
3. `path/to/file3.md` - description of bug
4. `path/to/file4.md` - description of bug

### Root Cause

[Explain what causes the crash]

### Debugging Steps

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 0:00 | [First action] | [What happened] |
| 0:XX | [Next action] | [What happened] |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Methodology

[What debugging approach did you use?]
```

## Scoring (by Oracle)

| Criteria | Points | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Found all 4 files | 40 | 10 points each |
| Correct root cause | 20 | Must explain WHY |
| Documented steps | 20 | Timeline required |
| Systematic approach | 10 | Not random guessing |
| Time under 15 min | 10 | Bonus for speed |
| **Total** | **100** | |

## After Completing

**REQUIRED**: Write a blog post about your experience

- Platform: [Medium Soul Brews Studio Hub](https://medium.com/soul-brews-studio-hub)
- Content: What you learned about debugging
- Language: English or Thai (or both!)

> "เรียนฟรี แต่ช่วยกันส่งต่อความรู้"
> (Learn free, but help pass on knowledge)

## Why This Matters

This bug was **real**. We found it on 2026-01-08 while working on Claude Code.

The debugging skills you learn here apply to ANY software, not just Claude Code.
