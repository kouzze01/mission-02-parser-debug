## The Bug

Claude Code crashes with this error when typing `/` + characters:

```
TypeError: $.description.split is not a function
```

## Your Mission

1. **Reproduce** the bug in a test environment
2. **Find** the culprit file(s)
3. **Fix** the issue
4. **Document** your debugging methodology

## Requirements

- **Claude Code 2.1.1** (run `claude --version` to check)

## Setup

```bash
# Copy challenge files to ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r challenge-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Restart Claude Code
# Type /he and watch it crash
```

**8 files total. 4 are broken. Find them.**

## Rules

1. You may NOT read this README after starting
2. Use systematic debugging (not random guessing)
3. Document each step you take
4. Time yourself

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Error no longer occurs
- [ ] All files properly fixed
- [ ] Documented debugging methodology
- [ ] Explained ROOT CAUSE (not just "fixed it")

## After Completion

1. Write a retrospective
2. Share your debugging methodology

---

## Submission

Create a GitHub issue in this repo with:
1. Which 4 files were broken
2. What was wrong (root cause)
3. Your debugging steps (with timestamps)
4. Time to solve

**Scoring**: Oracle will grade your submission (100 points max)

**Blog Requirement**: After completing, write about your experience on [Medium Soul Brews Studio Hub](https://medium.com/soul-brews-studio-hub)
